# Google Fit Sessions - Quick Reference

## üéØ The Core Issue

**Your historical sync doesn't fetch session data!**

```typescript
// Current code (line 217 in sync-historical-google-fit-data/index.ts)
sessions: [], // Could be enhanced to fetch actual sessions  ‚Üê THIS IS THE PROBLEM!
```

## üìä What You're Missing

Without sessions, you have:
- ‚úÖ Total steps for the day
- ‚úÖ Total calories burned
- ‚ùå **NO WORKOUT DETAILS**
- ‚ùå **NO ACTIVITY TYPES** (can't tell if it was running, cycling, etc.)
- ‚ùå **NO INDIVIDUAL WORKOUT TIMES**

## üîß The Fix

### Add Session Fetching to Historical Sync

```typescript
// Fetch sessions for each day (add this to your historical sync)
const sessionsRes = await fetch(
  `https://www.googleapis.com/fitness/v1/users/me/sessions?` +
  `startTime=${startOfDay.toISOString()}&` +
  `endTime=${endOfDay.toISOString()}`,
  {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}` }
  }
);

if (sessionsRes.ok) {
  const sessionsData = await sessionsRes.json();
  sessions = sessionsData.session || [];
}
```

## üöÄ Quick Deploy

```bash
cd /Users/habiebraharjo/fuel-score-friends/supabase/functions/sync-historical-google-fit-data

# Backup
cp index.ts index-backup.ts

# Replace
cp index-improved.ts index.ts

# Deploy
cd ..
supabase functions deploy sync-historical-google-fit-data
```

## üß™ Test After Deploy

```bash
# Run historical sync via your app
# Or use the interactive test:
node test-google-fit-sync-interactive.js
```

## ‚úÖ Verify Results

```sql
-- Check if sessions are now populated
SELECT 
  date, 
  steps,
  jsonb_array_length(sessions) as session_count
FROM google_fit_data
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id'
  AND date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

## üéì Key Learnings

### Google Fit Has Two Data Types:

1. **Aggregated Data** (what you currently get)
   - Daily totals: steps, calories, distance
   - No context about activities
   - Endpoint: `/dataset:aggregate`

2. **Session Data** (what you're missing)
   - Individual workouts
   - Activity types (run, cycle, swim)
   - Start/end times
   - Endpoint: `/sessions`

### Why Sessions Matter:

- **Training analysis**: Know if they ran or cycled
- **Workout tracking**: See individual workout performance  
- **Activity recommendations**: Better AI suggestions based on activity types
- **User insights**: Show workout history, not just step counts

### Activity Type Codes:

| Code | Activity | Code | Activity |
|------|----------|------|----------|
| 7 | Walking | 8 | Running |
| 9 | Jogging | 1 | Cycling |
| 82 | Swimming | 112 | CrossFit |
| 116 | HIIT | 117 | Spinning |

## üîç Why Sessions Might Still Be Missing

Even after the fix, some historical data may lack sessions because:

1. **User never logged workouts** - Just passive step tracking
2. **Auto-detection disabled** - Google Fit didn't detect activities
3. **Third-party app sync** - Apps that only sync totals, not sessions
4. **Old data** - Very old data may pre-date session tracking
5. **Privacy settings** - User restricted session data sharing

For these cases, you'll have aggregate data (steps/calories) but no detailed sessions.

## üìö Additional Resources

- **Analysis Document**: See `GOOGLE_FIT_API_SESSIONS_ANALYSIS.md` for full details
- **Deployment Guide**: See `GOOGLE_FIT_HISTORICAL_SYNC_IMPROVED.md` for comparison
- **Google Fit Docs**: https://developers.google.com/fit/rest/v1/sessions

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always fetch sessions** for any date-range sync
2. **Filter sessions** to exclude walking/commuting (already in improved version)
3. **Normalize activity names** for better UX (already in improved version)
4. **Store in separate table** (`google_fit_sessions`) for easier querying
5. **Add delays** between API calls to respect rate limits (already in improved version)

## üÜò Need Help?

- Check the detailed analysis in `GOOGLE_FIT_API_SESSIONS_ANALYSIS.md`
- Review the comparison in `GOOGLE_FIT_HISTORICAL_SYNC_IMPROVED.md`
- Test with `test-google-fit-sync-interactive.js`

---

**TL;DR**: Your historical sync doesn't call the Sessions API. I've created a fixed version that does. Deploy it and re-sync to get workout details! üéâ
