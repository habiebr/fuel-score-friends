## 🎯 How to Sync Historical Data

### Option 1: In the App (Recommended)

1. **Navigate**: Settings → App Integrations
2. **Connect**: Google Fit (if not already connected)
3. **Choose**: One of three sync options:
   - **7 days** - Quick backfill for recent data
   - **30 days** - Standard historical sync (recommended)
   - **90 days** - Full historical backfill

4. **Watch**: Progress bar shows "Syncing... X/Y days (Z%)"
5. **Done**: Toast notification confirms completion

### Option 2: Automatic (First Connection)

When you connect Google Fit for the first time:
- ✅ Automatically syncs **last 30 days**
- ✅ Runs in background
- ✅ Shows completion toast when done

## 📊 What Gets Synced

For each day in the selected range:

```
✓ Steps (daily total)
✓ Active minutes (moderate + vigorous activity)  
✓ Calories burned
✓ Distance (meters)
✓ Heart rate (average if available)
✓ Activity sessions (runs, workouts, cycling, etc.)
```

## 🔍 Verification

After syncing, verify the data was imported:

### Check 1: Dashboard
```
1. Go to Dashboard
2. Look for "Steps" widget
3. Scroll back through dates
4. Historical data should appear
```

### Check 2: Database
```sql
SELECT 
  date,
  steps,
  active_minutes,
  calories_burned
FROM google_fit_data
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 30;
```

### Check 3: Console
```javascript
// Open browser console
// Should see logs like:
"Starting historical sync for user abc-123, fetching 30 days back"
"Historical sync completed: 30 days synced"
```

## ⚡ Performance

| Days | Time | Data Points |
|------|------|-------------|
| 7 days | ~15 seconds | ~7 records |
| 30 days | ~60 seconds | ~30 records |
| 90 days | ~3 minutes | ~90 records |

*Note: Only days with activity data are synced*

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Historical sync failed"

**Solutions:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Reconnect Google Fit
3. Try smaller range (7 days instead of 90)
4. Check Google Fit app has data for those dates

### Progress stuck at 0%

**Possible Reasons:**
- No activity data in Google Fit for that period
- Google Fit token expired → Reconnect
- Network timeout → Try again with fewer days

### Some days missing

**Expected Behavior:**
- Days with no activity won't have data
- Google Fit only stores active days
- This is normal and correct

## 📱 Mobile & Desktop

Works on both:
- ✅ Desktop browser
- ✅ Mobile browser  
- ✅ PWA installed app
- ✅ iOS Safari
- ✅ Android Chrome

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### When to Use:

✅ **First-time setup** - Sync 30 days
✅ **Switching accounts** - Sync 90 days
✅ **Missing data** - Sync 7 days
✅ **After long break** - Sync 30-90 days

### When NOT to Use:

❌ Don't sync same period repeatedly
❌ Don't use instead of regular daily sync
❌ Avoid syncing >90 days (API limits)
