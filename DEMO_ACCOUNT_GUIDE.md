```

**Copy the user ID** from the output.

#### Step 2: Populate Demo Data

```bash
node create-demo-account.mjs populate abc123-def456-ghi789
```

SELECT date::date, COUNT(*) as meals, SUM(calories) as total_calories
FROM food_logs 
WHERE user_id = '<user-id>'
GROUP BY date::date
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 7;
```

### Check Nutrition Scores
```sql
SELECT date, daily_score, calories_consumed, protein_grams, carbs_grams
FROM nutrition_scores
WHERE user_id = '<user-id>'
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 7;
```

### Check Training Activities
```sql
SELECT date, activity_type, duration_minutes, distance_km, intensity, notes
FROM training_activities
WHERE user_id = '<user-id>'
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 7;
```

ORDER BY date DESC, meal_type;
```

### Check Wearable Data
```sql
SELECT date, steps, calories_burned, active_minutes, distance_meters
FROM wearable_data
WHERE user_id = '<user-id>'
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 7;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "User already exists"
**Solution:** Use existing user or delete old demo user first.

```sql
-- Delete demo user data
DELETE FROM profiles WHERE user_id = '<user-id>';
DELETE FROM food_logs WHERE user_id = '<user-id>';
DELETE FROM training_activities WHERE user_id = '<user-id>';
DELETE FROM nutrition_scores WHERE user_id = '<user-id>';
DELETE FROM daily_meal_plans WHERE user_id = '<user-id>';
DELETE FROM wearable_data WHERE user_id = '<user-id>';
DELETE FROM marathon_events WHERE user_id = '<user-id>';
```

### Issue: "Missing SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
**Solution:** 
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API
2. Copy **service_role** key (not anon key)
3. Add to `.env`: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-key-here`

### Issue: "No such file or directory: dotenv"
**Solution:** Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js dotenv
```

### Issue: SQL script shows errors
**Solution:** Make sure to replace `REPLACE_WITH_ACTUAL_USER_ID` with real UUID.
