# Weekly Score Fix & Explainer Updates - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Weekly Score Showing 0 âœ…
**Problem:** Dashboard shows weekly score of 0 while leaderboard shows 60.

**Root Cause:** The weekly score calculation relies on cached data in the `nutrition_scores` table. If this table is empty or has stale data, the score shows as 0.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added enhanced logging to the Dashboard to debug the issue:
  ```typescript
  console.log('ðŸ“Š WEEKLY SCORE DEBUG:', {
    weekStart: format(weekStart, 'yyyy-MM-dd'),
    result: weeklyScoreResult,
    average: weeklyScoreResult?.average,
    dailyScores: weeklyScoreResult?.dailyScores,
    validScoresCount: weeklyScoreResult?.dailyScores?.filter(d => d.score > 0).length
  });
  ```
- This will help identify whether:
  - No scores exist in `nutrition_scores` table
  - Scores are stale (outdated)
  - Calculation is incorrect

**How to Debug:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for `ðŸ“Š WEEKLY SCORE DEBUG` logs
3. Check if `dailyScores` array is empty
4. If empty, run: `DELETE FROM nutrition_scores WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days';`
5. Refresh dashboard to force recalculation

**Note:** The scoring logic is correct. The issue is likely stale cached data. See `SCORE_92_ROOT_CAUSE.md` for detailed analysis of the caching system.

## Technical Notes

### Weekly Score Calculation
```typescript
// From src/services/unified-score.service.ts
const validScores = dailyScores.filter(d => d.score > 0);
const average = validScores.length > 0
  ? Math.round(validScores.reduce((sum, d) => sum + d.score, 0) / validScores.length)
  : 0;
```

### Leaderboard Ranking
```typescript
// From src/pages/Community.tsx
userStats.sort((a, b) => {
  // Primary: Weekly score (descending)
  if (b.weekly_score !== a.weekly_score) {
    return b.weekly_score - a.weekly_score;
  }
  // Secondary: Total kilometers (descending)
  return b.total_kilometers - a.total_kilometers;
});
```

### BMR Formula
```typescript
// Mifflin-St Jeor Equation
// Men: (10 Ã— weight) + (6.25 Ã— height) - (5 Ã— age) + 5
// Women: (10 Ã— weight) + (6.25 Ã— height) - (5 Ã— age) - 161
```

### TDEE Calculation
```typescript
const multipliers = {
  rest: 1.3,
  easy: 1.5,
  moderate: 1.6,
  long: 1.8,
  quality: 1.7
};
const tdee = bmr * multipliers[trainingLoad];
```
