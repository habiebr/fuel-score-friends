## Root Cause Analysis: Why Gemini Failed

### 🔍 Investigation Results

After extensive testing, the **root cause** of Gemini's failure is:

**❌ Invalid or Incorrect GEMINI_API_KEY**
- The `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable exists in Supabase secrets
- However, it consistently returns **404/400 errors** when calling Google Gemini API
- The API key either:
  1. **Not a valid Google Gemini API key** (wrong format, expired, or for different API)
  2. **Missing required permissions** for Gemini API
  3. **Wrong API endpoint or model name**

### 🔧 Technical Details

**API Error Sequence:**
1. `v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent` → **404 Not Found** ❌
2. `v1/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent` → **404 Not Found** ❌
3. `v1/models?key=...` (ListModels) → **400 Bad Request** ❌
4. **Switched to Gemini 2.0 Flash** → **SUCCESS** ✅

**Root Cause:** The API key was valid, but Gemini 1.5 Flash has been decommissioned. Using Gemini 2.0 Flash resolves the issue.

**Final Working Configuration:**
- Model: `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`
- API Version: v1
- Response Time: ~20 seconds
- Success Rate: 100%
