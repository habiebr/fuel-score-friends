## 🎯 Performance Metrics Breakdown

### Core Web Vitals (Web Vitals)

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) | 10.4 s | < 2.5 s | 🔴 **CRITICAL** |

## ⚠️ Key Issues

### 1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) - 10.4 seconds** 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Problem**: LCP is taking 10.4 seconds, far exceeding the 2.5-second target
- **Impact**: Users see a blank page for 10+ seconds before main content appears
- **Root Causes**:
  - Large image/hero section loading slowly from Cloudflare CDN
  - Slow API response from Supabase
  - Possible unoptimized image delivery
  
**Recommended Fixes**:
- [ ] Implement image lazy loading with blur-up placeholders
- [ ] Use WebP format with PNG fallback for hero images
- [ ] Optimize image sizes (use responsive images)
- [ ] Consider moving images to Supabase Storage with optimization
- [ ] Reduce initial JavaScript bundle size
- [ ] Implement critical CSS inlining

### 2. **First Contentful Paint (FCP) - 2.6 seconds** 🟠 Slow
- **Problem**: Takes 2.6 seconds before first paint
- **Impact**: Perceived slowness on page load
- **Root Causes**:
  - JavaScript bundle size too large
  - Render-blocking resources
  - Heavy initial data fetching

**Recommended Fixes**:
- [ ] Code split React components (lazy loading)
- [ ] Defer non-critical JavaScript
- [ ] Use dynamic imports for routes
- [ ] Implement service worker precaching

## 🛠️ Action Plan

### High Priority (Do First)
1. **Optimize LCP** - This is the biggest issue
   - Implement responsive images with proper sizing
   - Use Cloudflare Image Optimization
   - Minimize initial bundle with code splitting

2. **Reduce FCP**
   - Split React bundle by route
   - Defer analytics/non-critical scripts

3. **Test on Slow Networks**
   - Use Chrome DevTools throttling (Slow 4G)
   - Profile with real device data

### Medium Priority
4. Implement critical CSS inlining
5. Add resource hints (`preconnect`, `dns-prefetch`)
6. Optimize fonts (subset fonts, use variable fonts)

### Low Priority
7. Minor accessibility improvements
8. SEO enhancements (structured data)

---

## 📈 Opportunities to Implement

### Estimated Impact
- **Fixing LCP**: +25-30 points ⚡
- **Fixing FCP**: +8-10 points ⚡
- **Total possible**: 98-100/100

---

## 🔍 Network Performance Notes

- **Page Load Time**: ~10.4 s (LCP)
- **Network**: Simulated Fast 3G equivalent
- **Device**: Simulated Moto G Power (2022)
- **Warning**: "The page loaded too slowly to finish within the time limit"

---

## 📱 PWA Status

✅ **Installable**: Yes
✅ **Service Worker**: Registered
✅ **Manifest**: Present
✅ **HTTPS**: Enabled
✅ **Responsive**: Mobile-first design

---

## 🎓 Recommendations by Category

### For Mobile Performance
- Prioritize visible content on critical rendering path
- Implement above-the-fold optimization
- Use `fetchpriority="high"` for LCP image
- Ensure main hero image is optimized

### For JavaScript
- Current bundle appears reasonable (SI good)
- Focus on lazy loading non-critical routes
- Consider code splitting with React.lazy()

### For Images
- Use picture/srcset for responsive images
- Generate WebP variants with PNG fallback
- Consider AVIF format for modern browsers
- Add `loading="lazy"` to off-screen images

---

## 🚀 Quick Wins

1. **Add `fetchpriority="high"` to hero image**
   ```html
   <img src="hero.webp" fetchpriority="high" />
   ```

2. **Implement service worker precaching**
   - Cache critical resources on install
   - Serve from cache-first strategy

3. **Use DNS prefetch for Supabase**
   ```html
   <link rel="dns-prefetch" href="//api.supabase.co" />
   ```

4. **Minify CSS/JS**
   - Already done via Vite, but verify

---

## 📊 Next Steps

1. ✅ Review the identified issues
2. ⚠️ Focus on LCP optimization first
3. 🧪 Run lighthouse audit after each change
4. 📈 Target: 90+ performance score
5. 🚀 Deploy improvements incrementally
