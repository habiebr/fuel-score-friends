## üìã Pre-Test Checklist

Run this SQL first to verify system health:

### **System Health Check** (Copy-paste into SQL Editor)

```sql
-- 1. Check cron jobs are active
SELECT 
  jobname,
  schedule,
  active,
  CASE WHEN active THEN '‚úÖ' ELSE '‚ùå' END as status
FROM cron.job
WHERE jobname LIKE '%sync%' OR jobname LIKE '%token%'
ORDER BY jobname;

-- Expected: 3 active jobs
-- ‚úÖ refresh-google-tokens (*/15 * * * *)
-- ‚úÖ sync-google-fit-frequent (*/10 * * * *)
-- ‚úÖ sync-google-fit-full (15 1 * * *)

-- 2. Check if cron ran recently
SELECT 
  j.jobname,
  r.start_time,
  r.status,
  r.return_message
FROM cron.job j
JOIN cron.job_run_details r ON j.jobid = r.jobid
WHERE j.jobname = 'sync-google-fit-frequent'
ORDER BY r.start_time DESC
LIMIT 3;

-- Expected: Recent runs in last hour with status 'succeeded'

-- 3. Check your Google Fit connection
SELECT 
  user_id,
  is_active,
  expires_at,
  CASE 
    WHEN expires_at > NOW() THEN '‚úÖ Valid'
    ELSE '‚ùå Expired'
  END as token_status
FROM google_tokens
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = '<YOUR_EMAIL>')
LIMIT 1;

-- Replace <YOUR_EMAIL> with your actual email
-- Expected: is_active = true, expires_at > now
```

## üîç Test 2: Verify Backend Detection (SQL)

After recording your workout, check if the backend detected it:

```sql
-- Find your user ID first
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = '<YOUR_EMAIL>';

-- Check if workout was synced
SELECT 
  activity_type,
  start_time,
  end_time,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - end_time))/60 as minutes_since_end,
  duration_minutes,
  distance_km,
  calories_burned
FROM google_fit_sessions
WHERE user_id = '<YOUR_USER_ID>'
AND end_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours'
ORDER BY end_time DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Expected: Your workout appears here

-- Check if notification was created
SELECT 
  title,
  message,
  scheduled_for,
  is_read,
  notes->>'workout_type' as workout_type,
  notes->>'minutes_since_end' as detection_delay
FROM training_notifications
WHERE user_id = '<YOUR_USER_ID>'
AND type = 'recovery'
AND scheduled_for > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours'
ORDER BY scheduled_for DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Expected: Notification created for your workout
```

## üìä Test Results Monitoring

### **Success Metrics:**

```sql
-- How many workouts detected today?
SELECT COUNT(*) as workouts_detected
FROM training_notifications
WHERE type = 'recovery'
AND scheduled_for > CURRENT_DATE;

-- Average detection delay
SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG((notes::json->>'minutes_since_end')::numeric), 1) as avg_delay_min,
  MIN((notes::json->>'minutes_since_end')::numeric) as min_delay,
  MAX((notes::json->>'minutes_since_end')::numeric) as max_delay
FROM training_notifications
WHERE type = 'recovery'
AND scheduled_for > CURRENT_DATE;

-- Target: 5-10 min average delay
```

## ‚úÖ Test Success Criteria:

- [ ] Console shows new detection logs
- [ ] Workout appears in `google_fit_sessions`

## üêõ Troubleshooting:

### **Issue: Widget doesn't appear**

**Check 1: Was workout synced?**
```sql
SELECT * FROM google_fit_sessions 
WHERE user_id = '<YOUR_USER_ID>'
AND end_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```
- If empty: Google Fit hasn't synced yet, wait 5 min

**Check 2: Was notification created?**
```sql
SELECT * FROM training_notifications 
WHERE user_id = '<YOUR_USER_ID>'
AND type = 'recovery'
ORDER BY scheduled_for DESC LIMIT 1;
```
- If empty: Workout might be > 30 min old

**Check 3: Clear cache**
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.removeItem('lastAckSessionId');
location.reload();
```

### **Issue: Old widget appears**

This means localStorage has a cached acknowledgment.

**Fix:**
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.removeItem('lastAckSessionId');
location.reload();
```

### **Issue: Cron not running**

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE active = false;
```

**Fix:** Re-enable the job if needed
