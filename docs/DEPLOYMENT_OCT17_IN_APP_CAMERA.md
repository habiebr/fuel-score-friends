## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Camera Permissions
**Issue:** User denies camera permission  
**Impact:** In-app camera won't work  
**Solution:** Clear error message, suggest using Gallery instead

### Older Browsers
**Issue:** Very old browsers without getUserMedia support  
**Impact:** In-app camera button might not work  
**Solution:** Graceful fallback to Gallery/Upload

### HTTPS Requirement
**Issue:** Camera API requires HTTPS  
**Impact:** Won't work on HTTP  
**Solution:** ✅ Already using HTTPS (app.nutrisync.id)

## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common User Questions

**Q: "Why do I need to grant camera permission?"**  
A: The in-app camera needs access to your device camera to take photos. This is a one-time permission request.

**Q: "Can I still use my phone's camera app?"**  
A: Yes! You can take photos with your camera app first, then use the "Gallery" button to select them.

**Q: "Why is In-App Camera recommended for Android?"**  
A: It prevents the page from reloading, which is a common issue on Android browsers. It provides a smoother experience.

**Q: "I'm not seeing the camera preview."**  
A: Check if you granted camera permission. If denied, try using the "Gallery" button instead, or enable camera access in your browser settings.
