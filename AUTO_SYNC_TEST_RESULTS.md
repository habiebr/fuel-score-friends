# Google Fit Auto-Sync Test Results - December 2024

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS! Function is Working

**Date**: December 15, 2024
**Test Method**: Manual CLI trigger via curl

### Test Command
```bash
curl -s -X POST https://eecdbddpzwedficnpenm.supabase.co/functions/v1/auto-sync-google-fit \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cc31eefcfdb9545d51cd6784229026eb559e8a8b4a05b77d4282fd3922bb6e5f" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Test Result
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "synced": 9,
  "skipped": 0,
  "errors": 1,
  "total": 10
}
```

### Analysis

#### ‚úÖ **Good News**
1. **Function is deployed and active** - Confirmed working
2. **Syncing 90% of users successfully** - 9 out of 10 synced
3. **No skipped users** - All users needed sync (fresh data)
4. **Function response is fast** - Returned immediately

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Minor Issue**
- **1 user failed to sync** (10% error rate)
- Need to check function logs to see why

### What This Means

**Problem**: The function works, but we need to verify:
1. **Is the cron job running automatically?** (Most important)
2. **Why did 1 user fail?** (Minor issue)
3. **Is data actually fresh?** (Need to check database)

## Next Steps

### 1. Check if Cron Job is Active

**Run this SQL query in Supabase Dashboard:**
```sql
-- Check if cron job exists
SELECT jobid, jobname, schedule, active, command 
FROM cron.job 
WHERE jobname = 'auto-sync-google-fit-every-5-min';
```

**Expected result:**
- Row exists with `active = true`
- Schedule = `*/5 * * * *`

**If no row found:**
- Cron job was never set up
- Run `setup_auto_sync_cron.sql` to create it

### 2. Check Recent Cron Runs

**Run this SQL query:**
```sql
-- Check if cron has been running
SELECT 
  jobid, 
  runid, 
  status, 
  return_message, 
  start_time, 
  end_time,
  end_time - start_time as duration
FROM cron.job_run_details
WHERE jobid = (
  SELECT jobid FROM cron.job 
  WHERE jobname = 'auto-sync-google-fit-every-5-min'
)
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**What to look for:**
- Recent runs (within last 5-10 minutes)
- Status = 'succeeded'
- No errors in return_message

**If no runs found:**
- Cron job exists but hasn't run yet
- May need to wait 5 minutes for first run
- Check if `active = true`

### 3. Verify Data Freshness

**Run this SQL query:**
```sql
-- Check when users' data was last synced
SELECT 
  user_id,
  date,
  last_synced_at,
  NOW() - last_synced_at as time_since_sync,
  steps,
  distance_meters / 1000.0 as distance_km,
  calories
FROM google_fit_data
WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE
  AND last_synced_at IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY last_synced_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Expected:**
- `time_since_sync` should be < 5-10 minutes
- `last_synced_at` should be very recent

**If data is old (> 1 hour):**
- Cron job is not running
- Need to set up cron (run setup_auto_sync_cron.sql)

### 4. Check the Failed User

**View function logs:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to: Edge Functions ‚Üí auto-sync-google-fit ‚Üí Logs
3. Look for error messages for the failed user
4. Common issues:
   - Expired OAuth token (should auto-refresh)
   - Google API rate limit
   - Invalid token

## Diagnosis Summary

### Current Status: üü° Partially Working

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Edge Function | ‚úÖ Deployed | Working correctly |
| Manual Trigger | ‚úÖ Success | 90% sync rate |
| Cron Job | ‚ùì Unknown | Needs verification |
| Data Freshness | ‚ùì Unknown | Needs checking |
| Weekly Miles | ‚ùì Unknown | Depends on data freshness |

### Most Likely Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Cron Job Not Set Up (Most Likely)
**Symptoms:**
- Function works when manually triggered ‚úÖ
- But data is stale (hours old)
- Weekly miles doesn't update

**Cause:**
- Cron job was never created
- Function exists but isn't scheduled to run

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Run setup_auto_sync_cron.sql in Supabase SQL Editor
```

#### Scenario 2: Cron Job Exists But Not Running
**Symptoms:**
- Cron job exists in database
- But hasn't run recently
- Data is stale

**Cause:**
- Cron job might be inactive
- pg_cron extension might not be enabled

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Enable cron
UPDATE cron.job 
SET active = true 
WHERE jobname = 'auto-sync-google-fit-every-5-min';

-- Verify pg_cron is enabled
SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_cron';
```

#### Scenario 3: Everything Works, Data Just Got Stale
**Symptoms:**
- Cron job exists and runs
- Recent runs show success
- Data was fresh, but now stale due to time passing

**Cause:**
- Normal - data becomes stale over time
- Next cron run (within 5 min) will refresh it

**Fix:**
- No fix needed
- Wait for next cron cycle
- Or manually trigger function

## Action Items

### Immediate (Do Now)

1. ‚úÖ **Test function manually** - DONE! (90% success)
2. ‚è≥ **Check if cron job exists** - Run SQL query #1 above
3. ‚è≥ **Verify cron is running** - Run SQL query #2 above
4. ‚è≥ **Check data freshness** - Run SQL query #3 above

### If Cron Missing (High Priority)

1. Run `setup_auto_sync_cron.sql` in SQL Editor
2. Wait 5 minutes
3. Check cron.job_run_details for runs
4. Verify data updates

### If Cron Exists But Not Running

1. Check if `active = true`
2. Enable if inactive
3. Check function logs for errors
4. Verify CRON_SECRET is set correctly

### Debug the 1 Failed User (Low Priority)

1. Check function logs for error details
2. Identify which user failed
3. Check their OAuth token status
4. May need user to reconnect Google Fit

## Conclusion

**Good News**: 
- ‚úÖ Function is deployed and working
- ‚úÖ 90% success rate is acceptable
- ‚úÖ No code changes needed

**Todo**:
- ‚ùì Verify cron job is set up
- ‚ùì Check if it's running automatically
- ‚ùì Confirm data is fresh

**Estimated Time to Fix**:
- If cron missing: 1 minute (run SQL script)
- If cron exists: Already working! üéâ

---

**Next Command to Run:**
```sql
-- Paste this in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT 
  jobid, 
  jobname, 
  schedule, 
  active 
FROM cron.job 
WHERE jobname LIKE '%google%' OR jobname LIKE '%sync%';
```

This will show all sync-related cron jobs and tell us if auto-sync is scheduled.
