# PWA Deployment Guide

This project is now fully configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA) and ready for deployment.

## PWA Features Implemented

### ✅ Core PWA Requirements
- **Web App Manifest**: Automatically generated with proper metadata
- **Service Worker**: Auto-generated with Workbox for caching and offline support
- **HTTPS Ready**: Configured for secure deployment
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper viewport settings

### ✅ Enhanced PWA Features
- **Offline Support**: Cached resources and offline fallback page
- **Install Prompts**: Native install buttons and prompts
- **Update Notifications**: Automatic update notifications for new versions
- **App-like Experience**: Standalone display mode with custom icons
- **Background Sync**: Service worker handles background updates

### ✅ Mobile Optimization
- **iOS Support**: Apple touch icons and splash screens
- **Android Support**: Maskable icons and proper manifest
- **Meta Tags**: Comprehensive mobile and social media meta tags
- **Viewport**: Optimized for mobile devices

## Build and Deploy

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build:pwa
```

### Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
```bash
npm run pwa:deploy
```

## PWA Components

### usePWA Hook
Located at `src/hooks/usePWA.tsx`
- Manages PWA state (online/offline, install status)
- Handles service worker registration
- Provides install and update functions

### PWA Components
- `PWAUpdateNotification`: Shows update notifications
- `PWAInstallButton`: Install button component
- `PWAInstallPrompt`: Full install prompt banner
- `Offline`: Offline fallback page

## Configuration

### Vite PWA Plugin
The PWA functionality is configured in `vite.config.ts`:
- Auto-update service worker
- Workbox caching strategies
- Custom manifest generation
- Icon generation

### Caching Strategy
- **Static Assets**: Cache first with long expiration
- **API Calls**: Network first with fallback to cache
- **Supabase**: Network first with 7-day cache
- **Fonts**: Cache first with 1-year expiration

## Testing PWA Features

### Local Testing
1. Run `npm run build:pwa`
2. Serve the `dist` folder with a local server
3. Open in Chrome DevTools
4. Check Application tab for:
   - Manifest
   - Service Worker
   - Storage

### PWA Audit
Use Chrome DevTools Lighthouse to audit PWA features:
1. Open DevTools → Lighthouse
2. Select "Progressive Web App"
3. Run audit

### Installation Testing
1. Open the app in Chrome/Edge
2. Look for install button in address bar
3. Test install functionality
4. Verify app works offline
